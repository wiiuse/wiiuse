**NOTE**: This library sees little change not because it is dead,
but because it is effectively "complete".
That being said, if you think there are changes that it could use,
and are willing to step up to assist with maintenance,
please file an issue.

## About

Wiiuse is a library written in C that connects with several Nintendo
Wii remotes. Supports motion sensing, IR tracking, nunchuk, classic
controller, Balance Board, and the Guitar Hero 3 controller. Single
threaded and nonblocking makes a light weight and clean API.

Distributed under the GPL 3+.

This is a friendly fork, prompted by apparent non-maintained status
of upstream project but proliferation of ad-hoc forks without
project infrastructure. Balance board support has been merged from
[TU-Delft][1] cross-referenced with other similar implementations in
embedded forks of WiiUse in other applications. Additional community
contributions have since been merged. Hopefully GitHub will help the
community maintain this project more seamlessly now.

Patches and improvements are greatly appreciated - the easiest way
to submit them is to fork the repository on GitHub and make the
changes, then submit a pull request. The "fork and edit this file"
button on the web interface should make this even simpler.

## Audience

This project is intended for developers who wish to include support
for the Nintendo Wii remote with their third party application.

## Supported Hardware

### Official Nintendo controllers:

- Wiimotes:
  - Gen 1.0 - Original Wiimote without Motion Plus (Bluetooth name: RVL-CNT-01)
  - Gen 1.5 - Same as gen 1 but has integrated Motion Plus (Bluetooth name: RVL-CNT-01)
  - Gen 2.0 - New Wiimote (since about 2011), has integrated Motion
    Plus and different firmware (Bluetooth name: RVL-CNT-01-TR)

- Wii Balance Board (Bluetooth name: RVL-WBC-01)

- Expansions:
  - Nunchuk
  - Classic controller
  - Guitar controller
  - Motion Plus dongle (for the gen 1 Wiimote)

### Clones and 3rdparty devices

3rdparty controllers (wiimotes, nunchuks etc.) may or may not work -
some manufacturers take major liberties with the protocols so it is
impossible to guarantee functionality. However, most will probably
just work.


## Platforms and Dependencies

Wiiuse currently operates on Linux, Windows and Mac. You will need:

### For Linux

- The kernel must support Bluetooth
- The BlueZ Bluetooth drivers must be installed
- If compiling, you'll need the BlueZ dev files (Debian/Ubuntu package
  `libbluetooth-dev`)

### For Windows

- Bluetooth driver (tested with Microsoft's stack with Windows XP SP2 thru Windows 10)

### For Mac

- Mac OS X 10.2 or newer (to have the Mac OS X Bluetooth protocol stack)

### For all platforms

- If compiling, [CMake](http://cmake.org) is needed to generate a makefile/project

## Compiling

You need SDL and OpenGL installed to compile the (optional) SDL example.

### Linux & Mac

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. [-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local] [-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release] [-DBUILD_EXAMPLE_SDL=NO]

OR

    cmake-gui ..
    make [target]

If `target` is omitted then everything is compiled.

Where `target` can be any of the following:

- *wiiuse* - Compiles `libwiiuse.so`
- *wiiuseexample* - Compiles `wiiuse-example`
- *wiiuseexample-sdl* - Compiles `wiiuse-sdl`
- *doc* - Generates doxygen-based API documentation in HTML and PDF
  format in `docs-generated`

For a system-wide install, become root (or run with `sudo`) and:

    make install

- `libwiiuse.so` is installed to `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib`
- `wiiuse-example` and `wiiuse-sdl` are installed to `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/bin`

### Windows

The CMake GUI can be used to generate a Visual Studio solution.

You may need to install the Windows SDK (in recent versions) or
DDK (driver development kit - for old Windows SDK only) to compile
wiiuse.

With Visual Studio Community 2017, this is very easy to build now:
if you have chosen to install the "desktop C++" tools,
you'll automatically have what you need.

## Using the Library

To use the library in your own program you must first compile wiiuse as
a module. Include `include/wiiuse.h` in any file that uses wiiuse.

For Linux you must link `libwiiuse.so` ( `-lwiiuse` ). For Windows you
must link `wiiuse.lib`. When your program runs it will need
`wiiuse.dll`.

## Known Issues

On Windows using more than one wiimote (usually more than two wiimotes)
may cause significant latency.

If you are going to use Motion+, make sure to call `wiiuse_poll` or `wiiuse_update`
in a loop for some 10-15 seconds before enabling it. Ideally you should be checking
the status of any expansion (nunchuk) you may have connected as well.
Otherwise the extra expansion may not initialize correctly - the initialization
and calibration takes some time.

### Mac OS X

Wiiuse can only connect to a device if it is in discoverable mode. Enable discoverable
mode by pressing the button on the inside of the battery cover.

Wiiuse may not be able to connect to the device if it has been paired to the
operating system. Unpair it by opening Bluetooth Preferences (Apple > System
Preferences > Bluetooth), selecting the device (e.g., "Nintendo RVL-CNT-01"), and
pressing the X next to the device (alternatively: right-click and select "Remove"). It is
not enough to simply disconnect it.

Enable discoverable mode and try again.

## Known Forks/Derivative Versions

The last "old upstream" version of WiiUse was 0.12. A number of projects
forked or embedded that version or earlier, making their own improvements.
A (probably incomplete) list follows, split between those whose improvements
are completed integrated into this new mainline version, and those whose
improvements have not yet been ported/merged into this version. An eventual
goal is to integrate all appropriate improvements (under the GPL 3+) back
into this mainline community-maintained "master fork" - contributions are
greatly appreciated.

### Forks that have been fully integrated

- [TU Delft's version with Balance Board support](http://graphics.tudelft.nl/Projects/WiiBalanceBoard)
  - Added balance board support only.
  - Integrated into mainline 0.13.

### Forks not yet fully integrated

- [libogc/wiiuse](https://github.com/devkitPro/libogc/tree/master/wiiuse)
  - wii port created by Shagkur and contributed upstream
  - Focused on Wiimote use with Wii hardware
  - code unfortunately diverged
  - Additional functionality unknown?
- [fwiine](http://sourceforge.net/projects/fwiine/files/wiiuse/0.13/)
  - Created an 0.13 version with some very preliminary MotionPlus support.
  - Integrated into branch `fwiine-motionplus`, not yet merged pending
    alternate MotionPlus merge from WiiC by Jan Ciger.
- [DolphinEmu](https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin)
  - used to have a WiiUse fork labeled version 0.13.0 (no relation to 0.13 in this current project)
  - Embedded, converted to C++, drastically changed over time,
    mostly unrecognizable, and then removed before 3.0.
  - Added Mac support.
  - Added code to handle finding and pairing wiimotes on windows.
  - A mostly intact version is here:
    <https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin/tree/2.0/Externals/WiiUseSrc>
  - Last code state before removal is here:
    <https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin/tree/b038df64bfad478c4e2605985809f58f351ec11c/Source/Core/wiiuse>
  - Their new replacement is <https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin/tree/master/Source/Core/Core/HW/WiimoteReal>
- [paulburton on github](https://github.com/paulburton/wiiuse)
  - Added balance board support - skipped in favor of the TU Delft version.
  - Added static library support - not yet added to the mainline.
- [KzMz on github)](https://github.com/KzMz/wiiuse_fork)
  - Started work on speaker support.
- [WiiC](https://github.com/grandelli/WiiC)
  - Dramatically changed, C++ API added.
