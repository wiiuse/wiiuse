ABOUT

	Wiiuse is a library written in C that connects with several Nintendo
	Wii remotes. Supports motion sensing, IR tracking, nunchuk, classic
	controller, Balance Board, and the Guitar Hero 3 controller. Single
	threaded and nonblocking makes a light weight and clean API.

	Distributed under the GPL 3+.

	This is a friendly fork, prompted by apparent non-maintained status
	of upstream project but proliferation of ad-hoc forks without
	project infrastructure. Balance board support has been merged from
	TU-Delft [1] cross-referenced with other similar implementations in
	embedded forks of WiiUse in other applications. Hopefully GitHub will
	help the community maintain this project more seamlessly now.

	Patches and improvements are greatly appreciated - the easiest way
	to submit them is to fork the repository on GitHub and make the
	changes, then submit a pull request. The "fork and edit this file"
	button on the web interface should make this even simpler.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS BY MICHAEL LAFOREST

	http://wiibrew.org/
		This site and their users have contributed an immense amount of
		information about the wiimote and its technical details. I could
		not have written this program without the vast amounts of
		reverse engineered information that was researched by them.

	Nintendo
		Of course Nintendo for designing and manufacturing the Wii and Wii remote.

	BlueZ
		Easy and intuitive bluetooth stack for Linux.

	Thanks to Brent for letting me borrow his Guitar Hero 3 controller.


AUDIENCE

	This project is intended for developers who wish to include support
	for the Nintendo Wii remote with their third party application.

PLATFORMS AND DEPENDENCIES

	Wiiuse currently operates on both Linux and Windows.
	You will need:

	For Linux:
		- The kernel must support bluetooth
		- The BlueZ bluetooth drivers must be installed
		- If compiling, you'll need the BlueZ dev files (Debian/Ubuntu package
		  libbluetooth-dev)

	For Windows:
		- Bluetooth driver (tested with Microsoft's stack with Windows XP SP2)
		- If compiling, Microsoft Windows Driver Development Kit (DDK)

	For either platform:
		- If compiling, CMake is needed to generate a makefile

COMPILING

	Linux:
		You need SDL and OpenGL installed to compile the SDL example.

		$ cd build

		$ ccmake .. [-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local] [-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release]
			OR
		$ cmake-gui ..

		$ make [target]

		If 'target' is omitted then everything is compiled.

		Where 'target' can be any of the following:

			- wiiuse
				Compiles libwiiuse.so

			- wiiuseexample
				Compiles wiiuse-example

			- wiiuseexample-sdl
				Compiles wiiuse-sdl

			- doc
				Generates doxygen-based API documentation in HTML and PDF
				format in docs-generated

		Become root.

		# make install

		libwiiuse.so is installed to CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib
		wiiuse-example and wiiuse-sdl are installed to CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/bin

	Windows:
		The CMake GUI can be used to generate a Visual Studio solution.

		You need the install the Windows DDK (driver development kit)
		to compile wiiuse.
		You can download this from here:
			http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/devtools/ddk/default.mspx

		You might also need to install the latest Windows SDK.


USING THE LIBRARY IN A THIRD PARTY APPLICATION

	To use the library in your own program you must first compile wiiuse as a module.
	Include include/wiiuse.h in any file that uses wiiuse.

	For Linux you must link wiiuse.so ( -lwiiuse ).
	For Windows you must link wiiuse.lib.  When your program runs it will need wiiuse.dll.


BUGS

	On Windows using more than one wiimote (usually more than two wiimotes) may cause
	significant latency.
